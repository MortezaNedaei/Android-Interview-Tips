## Commit Messages

Commit messages should follow the following syntax:

```
<type>(<flavor>): <message>
```

For example:
```
Feat(Kotlin): add awesome tip
```

The `<type>` can be one of the following:

- **Feat** (new feature)
- **Fix** (bug fix)
- **Docs** (changes to the documentation)
- **Style** (formatting, etc; no production code change)
- **Refactor** (refactoring code, e.g. renaming a variable)
- **Test** (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- **Wip** (work in progress, e.g, working on a feature but not complete yet)
- **Chore** (a routine task, e.g, upgrade version name)
